# Localisation

Welcome to the openPilotLog Localisation Wiki! If you are interested in making openPilotLog available in your native language, this is where you will find information and resources on how to do it. The good news is that the process is pretty straight-forward and only requires basic computer skills.

## Requirements

In order to work an a translation for openPilotLog, you'll need 2 things:
- a translation (.ts) file for the target language
- The Qt Translation Tool Qt Linguist, which you can download [here](https://github.com/thurask/Qt-Linguist/releases).

To get the translation file, first check if there is already a translation file in the [repository](https://github.com/fiffty-50/openpilotlog/tree/develop/l10n). If so, download it, load up Qt Linguist and you are off to the races. On the [Qt Website](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html) you can find an excellent introduction on how to use Qt Linguist. For Text formatting, openPilotLog uses HTML4 Markup, you can find a list of the supported subset [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/richtext-html-subset.html)

If no translation file exists for your language, you can either [create it yourself](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-manager.html#using-lupdate) using Qt Linguist if you are an advanced user, or [send an E-Mail](mailto:felix.turo@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Contributing%20to%20openPilotLog%20-%20Translations) and we can do it for you.
