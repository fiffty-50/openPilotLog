.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBPilotsWidget\fP is used to view, edit, delete or add new pilots\&. 

The widget consists of two main parts, a \fIQTableView\fP on the left side and a \fIQStackedWidget\fP on the right side\&.
.PP
In the QTableView, a QSqlTableModel is used to access a view from the database, which holds a Pilots' Last Name, First name and Company\&.
.PP
The welcome page shown on the QStackedWidget on the right side has a QLineEdit that functions as a search box and a QCombobox holding the possible columns that can be used to filter what is displayed\&. The text of the QLineEdit is used as a filter for the QSqlTableModel, so the view is updated in real time\&.
.PP
The \fI\fBNewPilotDialog\fP\fP is used for creating a new entry as well as for editing an existing entry\&. If the user selects a row in the QTableView, the \fBNewPilotDialog\fP is displayed on the right side of the Widget, inside the QStackedWidget\&. In order to avoid leaks from any previously made selections, existing Dialogs are deleted before a new one is created\&. The \fBNewPilotDialog\fP's \fCaccepted\fP and \fCrejected\fP signals are connected to refresh the view as required\&.
.PP
The logbook owner is not shown in the QTableView as an editable Pilot since \fCself\fP is a special reserved alias for the pilot with ROWID #1 as a way to identify and adequately display the logbook owner in the logbook\&. Editing personal details is done via the \fI\fBSettingsWidget\fP\fP
