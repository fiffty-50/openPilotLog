.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBALog\fP namespace encapsulates constants and functions used to provide logging to files and logging to console (stdout) 

The console output is color coded - green, amber, magenta for info, warn and crit messages, whereas the log files are just plain text\&.
.PP
There is a maximum of <numberOfLogs> log files with a maximum size of <sizeOfLogs>, at the moment, up to 10 logs of up to 100kB in size are kept, older logs are automatically deleted\&.
.PP
Debug output is not written to the logfile\&.
.PP
In order to start logging, the \fBALog::init()\fP function has to be called

.PP
aMessageHandler Intercepts Messages and prints to console and log file The message handler is responsible for intercepting the output from qDebug(), qInfo(), qWarning() and qCritical(), formatting them and printing them to the standard console out and to a logfile using QTextStream\&. Debug messages are not written to the log file\&.
