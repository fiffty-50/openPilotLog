 * \brief The ATimer class provides an easy to use performance timer.
 *
 * It automatically stops when going out of scope and prints the elapsed time
 * to the console. Intermediate timings can be manually obtained with timeNow().
 *
 * It can be given a QObject as a parent to time its lifetime or can be used without
 * parent in any context.
