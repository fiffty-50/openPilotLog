# openPilotLog

Welcome to openPilotLog, the free and open source airline pilot logbook application!

## Tl;dr

Airline pilots are required to maintain a logbook containing details of their flights. These logbooks were historically written by hand on paper, but of course nowadays more and more people are doing it electronically, be it in their own excel sheet or using a paid logbook software.

I have used paid solutions for many years, and have seen more and of them move from being a one-time license purchase to becoming a "Logbook as a Service" type subscription. After the one I have been using for the last couple of years, and had bought a "lifetime license" for ended up announcing they also moved to a subscription based service, I decided that it is time for a free and open source alternative that is fast, easy to use, and does not require a subscription.
